                                    <h2>Introduction to Budgeting</h2>
                                    <p><span class="image right"><img src="images/needs.png" alt="" /></span>
                                        Money management is one of the most important life skills you can learn, and it all starts with budgeting. This section will teach you the fundamentals of budgeting in a way that's easy to understand and apply to your everyday life. 
                                        <ol>
                                            <li><b>What is a Budget? </b> </br>A budget is a plan for how you spend and save your money. It helps you control your finances by keeping track of your income (money you make) and expenses (money you spend).</li>
										</br><li><b>Why Budgeting Matters? </b> </br>Budgeting is important because it helps you to take control of your financial future by building healthy financial habits early on and setting the foundation for lifelong financial security. A budget helps to track your income and expenses, ensuring you’re living within your means and working toward financial goals. It helps you to avoid running out of money and save for things you need or want in life such as good education, new clothes, a new house, medical treatments, vacations etc.</li>
										</br><li><b>Spending vs. Saving: </b></br><b>Spending:</b> Spending is what we do with money for immediate needs and wants. It's important to distinguish between essential expenses (like food, rent, and utilities) and discretionary spending (like entertainment and dining out). Refer to <a href="lesson_spending.html">Needs vs Wants section</a> to learn more about different types of spending. </br> <b>Saving:</b> Saving is putting aside money for future use. It helps you deal with unexpected expenses (like car repairs or medical bills) and plan for future goals (like buying a house, college, or retirement). Saving money teaches discipline and prepares you for emergencies or larger purchases in the future.</li>
										</br><li><b>Understanding Income: </b></br><b>Income </b>is the money that you receive in exchange for providing labor, selling goods, offering services, or making investments. It is essentially the flow of money into your personal finances, which can be used to cover expenses, save, or invest. Your income can come from various sources, such as </br>
                                                <ul>
                                                    <li><b>Wages or Salary: </b> Money earned from a job or employment.</li>
                                                    <li><b>Business Profits:  </b>Income from running a business such as selling any goods or providing services.</li>
                                                    <li><b>Investments:  </b>Earnings from dividends, interest, or the sale of assets like stocks or real estate.</li>
                                                    <li><b>Rental Income: </b>Money earned from renting out property such as real estate, equipment or furniture.</li>
                                                    <li><b>Donations or Benefits: </b>Money received from social security, unemployment benefits, or other financial assistance.</li>
                                                </ul>
                                            
                                            </li>
                                        <p>   Money management is a fundamental part of financial stability and is used to manage daily living costs, build wealth, and plan for the future.    </p>
                                        </p>
                                        </ol>

                                        <h2>How to Create a Simple Budget</h2>
                                        <p><span class="image left"><img src="images/wants.jpg" alt="" /></span>
                                            Creating a simple budget is one of the most effective ways to take control of your finances and plan for both short-term needs and long-term goals. A budget helps you understand where your money is coming from, where it’s going, and how you can adjust your spending to save more or avoid debt. </br></br>By setting up a basic plan, you can track your income and expenses, prioritize essential costs, and make informed decisions about your financial future. Whether you're managing a small income or preparing for bigger goals, creating a simple budget is an essential skill for financial success. Here’s a step-by-step guide to help you get started on creating a simple budget that works for you:</br></br></br>
                                         <ol>
                                            <li><b>Write Down Your Income: </b> Track how much you receive each week or month from various sources as mentioned in the above section.
                                            </br></br><li><b>List Your Expenses: </b> Break down your spending into needs and wants. Use a notebook, budgeting app, or spreadsheet.
                                            </br></br><li><b>Subtract Your Expenses from Income: </b> Calculate how much money you have left after covering your expenses. If you’re spending more than you make or if you don't have enough money left over for future financial goals, it’s time to adjust.       
                                            </br></br><li><b>Adjust and Stick to Your Budget: </b> Make adjustments if you’re overspending in certain areas. Try to stick to the amounts you’ve budgeted for each category.
                                            </br></br><li><b>Budgeting Tools and Resources: </b> You could either use some free apps (such as Mint, YNAB etc) to create and manage a budget or use a googlesheet or excel sheet to do so. This is a simple budget template you could use to start budgeting: <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YlGTsomx1Y47jdc9HMdV4iVLP9vtZEcNJZQWHLTc1jk/edit?gid=0#gid=0">Budget Template.</a>
                                        </p>
                                        </ol>
                                        <p>Remember that budgeting now sets you up for future financial success, whether it's financial freedom, early investments, or a big future purchase.</p>

                                        <h2>The 50/30/20 Rule </h2>
                                        <p><span class="image right"><img src="images/needs.png" alt="" /></span>
                                            This rule is a simple guideline to help you divide your money that you have earned or received between needs, wants and savings. 
                                            <ol>
                                                <li><b>50% on Needs: </b> Spend up to half of your money on essentials like food, rent or mortgage, transportation and all other necessary expenses. Refer <a href="lesson_spending.html">Needs vs Wants section</a> to identify which expenses fall into this category of needs.</li>
												</br><li><b>30% on Wants: </b> Spend or Save up to 30% of your income on things you enjoy, like hobbies or entertainment. You could either spend the 30% on immediate wants or save it for things you want to do in future such as vacation, big house, etc. Refer <a href="lesson_spending.html">Needs vs Wants section</a> to identify which expenses fall into this category of wants. </li>
												</br><li><b>20% on Savings: </b>Save at least 20% of your income and invest in things that will either appreciate in value or generate passive income such as public company stocks, real estate investment, etc. There is no limit to this category, 20% is just a minimum guideline to achieve. If your income is high & spending is low then save and invest more than 20% of your income. Refer <a href="lesson_invest.html">Investing section</a> to learn how to invest.</li>
                                            <br>
                                            Example for a college student: Say, you consistently earn about $1,000 a month from providing tution to other students:
                                               <ul> 
                                                <li>$500 could go to needs (like school fees, rent, bus fare or school supplies). If your needs are higher than 50%, allocate a higher percentage of your income to cover your basic needs.</li>
                                                <li>$300 could be for wants (like movies or snacks or save a part of it for a future desire such as a vacation trip). Remember spend money on wants only after your basic needs are met with your income. Read <a href="lesson_spending.html">Live Below Your Means section</a> to minimize the money you spend on wants.</li>
                                                <li>$200 would go into savings (like investment in the stock market or saving the money in a savings bank account). Encourage yourself to save any leftover money even if it's a higher percentage than 20%. </li> </p>
                                            There may be a situation that your needs are much higher than 50%, in such situations, prioritize your needs first, try to reduce wants and try to save as much money as possible to secure a better financial future. </p>
                                                </ul>
                                        </ol>
                                    <hr />
                                    <h2>Conclusion </h2>
                                    <p>Budgeting is a lifelong skill that can help you make the most of your money, avoid debt, and work towards your goals. The earlier you start, the more confident and successful you’ll be in managing your finances as you grow older. </p>
