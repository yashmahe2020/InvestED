										<h1>Lessons: Understand Money Basics</h1>
									</header>
									<hr />
									<p> Money. It’s something we all want but sometimes don’t know how to handle. Whether you're saving up for the latest gadget, trying to figure out how to pay for college, probably looking to buy a house, or dreaming of financial independence, learning how to manage money is one of the most important life skills you can have. But don’t worry, personal finance doesn’t have to be boring. </br></br>In this section, we’re going to break down the essentials of money management in a fun, simple, and interactive way. Let’s dive into the world of personal finance, where you can learn to make money work for you—not the other way around! No need for boring textbooks or long lectures. </br></br><b>Let’s dive in!</b></p>
                                    <hr />
                                    <h2>What’s the Deal with Personal Finance?</h2>
                                    <p><span class="image right"><img src="images/cash.png" alt="" /></span> Think of personal finance as your own “money game.” Just like you’d level up in a video game or learn new tricks in a sport, you can master the skills of managing your money. It’s all about learning how to earn, save, spend, and grow your money in a way that works best for you. Imagine this: Money is your tool for unlocking cool things—whether it’s buying a new gadget, going on a dream vacation, or starting your own business. But to use these tools effectively, you need to know how to get them, how to save them, and how to use them wisely.</p>
                                      
                                        <h2>Money = Freedom (Not Stress!)</h2>
                                        <p>Managing money is all about freedom. You know that feeling when you’re about to finish a big school project and all that’s left is freedom to hang out with friends or play your favorite game? That’s what money management can do for you in life. The goal is simple: Understand how to earn, save, and spend money so that you can live life on your own terms. That means more adventures, less stress, and financial freedom as you get older.
                                        
                                            <hr />
                                            
                                            <h2>Budgeting: Your Superpower</h2>
                                            <p><span class="image left"><img src="images/budget.jpeg" alt="" /></span> Think of a budget as your personal money map. Without it, you might wander aimlessly, spending money here and there until—oops!—you’re broke. But with a budget, you’re in control. </br> </br>A budget helps you:
                                             <ul>
                                            <li><b>Your Income: </b> Know how much money you earn, how much more you can earn and how much money you have</li>
                                            <li><b>Your Expenses: </b> Understand how much you’re spending and how much you really need to spend</li>
                                            <li><b>Your goals: </b> Decide what you want to save for. If you don't know, save and invest the most you can.</li>
                                        </br></br>

                                        <p>   The best part? You’re the one in charge! You can spend guilt-free on the things you love because you know you’ve planned for it.</p>
                                        </p>
                                        </ul>

                                        <h2>Income: How to Earn Like a Pro</h2>
                                        <p><span class="image right"><img src="images/passive.jpg" alt="" /></span> Income is just a fancy word for money coming in. It could be your allowance, a paycheck from your part-time job, or even money from selling clothes you no longer wear. But here’s the best part—you don’t need to wait until you’re older to start making serious cash.

                                            <li><b>Freelance your skills: </b> Got skills in design, photography, or writing? <b><a href="skills.html">Learn new skills.</a> </b>Start offering your services online or locally.
                                            <li><b>Sell unwanted stuff:  </b> From old clothes to old electronics, selling things you don’t use is an easy way to make quick cash.
                                            <li><b>Start a side hustle:  </b> Love pets? Offer dog-walking services. Good at tutoring? Help classmates out for a fee.
                                            </br> </br> <p> There are many more ways to earn passive income with a small upfront investment of time and money. <b><a href="passive.html">Learn How to Make Passive Income</a> </b> </p>

                                        </p>
                                        </ul>

                                        <h2> Spending: Have Fun, But Be Smart</h2>
                                        <p><span class="image left"><img src="images/shop.png" alt="" /></span> Spending money is the fun part of managing finances—who doesn’t love buying new things? But here’s the trick: Spend smart so you don’t run out of money when it really matters.
                                        </br> </br>How to Spend Without Regrets:
                                         <ul>
                                            <li><b>Prioritize needs over wants:  </b> Sure, that new video game looks awesome, but is it more important than paying for your phone bill or saving for your dream vacation?
                                            <li><b>Use the 50/30/20 rule: </b> 50% of your money goes to needs, 30% goes to current and future wants, and 20% goes to savings and investments. This way, you can have fun while still planning for the future.
                                            <li><b>Avoid impulse buying: </b> Take a second before buying something. Ask yourself: Will I still want this in a month?
                                            </br> </br> <p> </br><b><a href="needwant.html">Learn How to Live Below Your Means</a> </b>and secure your financial future by building the right habits. </p>
                                            Being smart about spending doesn’t mean cutting out all the fun. It just means balancing the now with the future.
                                        </p>
                                        </ul>
                                        <hr />
                                        <h2> Saving: Your Future Self Will Thank You</h2>
                                        <p><span class="image right"><img src="images/save.png" alt="" /></span> Picture this: Your future self is chilling, debt-free, living life, and enjoying the things they love. Why? Because you started saving early! Saving money is all about making sure you’re prepared for tomorrow.
                                        </br> </br>Here’s why saving is super important:
                                         <ul>
                                            <li><b>Emergency fund:  </b> Life is full of surprises. Your phone breaks, you need new shoes, or you get sick. An emergency fund keeps you covered.
                                            <li><b>Big dreams: </b> Saving up for a new laptop, car, home or college tuition? Start small and watch your savings grow over time.
                                            <li><b>Future fun:  </b> When you save now, you can afford to splurge later on the things that truly matter to you.
                                            </br> </br> <p> <b>Pro Tip: Pay Yourself First!</b></p>
                                            Before you start spending, always save a portion of your income. Whether it’s 10% or 20%, setting aside money first means you’ll never run out when you need it.
                                        </p>
                                        </ul>
                                        <hr />
                                        <h2> Investing: Your Money’s Growth Hack</h2>
                                        <p><span class="image left"><img src="images/investflow.png" alt="" /></span> If you want your money to grow like a magic beanstalk, investing is where it’s at. Unlike saving, where you stash money away for safekeeping, investing allows your money to grow by earning returns.
                                        </br> </br><b><a href="invest.html">Getting started with investing doesn’t have to be complicated. </br>Learn the magic. Start today!</a> </b>
                                    </br>  </br> </br>
                                            The key to investing is starting young. Even if it’s just a little bit, the longer your money has to grow, the more you’ll benefit from <b>compound interest </b>(where your money earns money on the money it’s already earned!).
                                        </p>
                                  
                                        <hr />
                                    <h2>Financial Freedom: The Ultimate Goal </h2>
                                    <p>All these personal finance tips lead to one main goal—<b>financial freedom</b>. Financial freedom means you have enough money saved, invested, and well-managed that you can live life on your own terms. No stressing about bills, no living paycheck to paycheck, just peace of mind and more opportunities to enjoy life.</p>
